# soluteatoms

Investigating the effect of solute atoms and core on dislocation pattern formation.

## About this file

This is the readme file for my project hosted at [danieltuzes/soluteatoms](https://github.com/danieltuzes/soluteatoms). This file is manually created by me and contains some description of this project.

## About this project

The purpose of this project is to model dislocation patterns in the presence of solute atoms. The theory itself is also developed here which is based on the continuum theory of dislocations in the local density approximation.

This project is abandonned, as no remarkable results were found. I also found other projects more interesting, and I also left the academy. Since then, I learn python and right now, I am learning git. This will be useful later.

It is always good to learn new things.
